  "Supervised_Machine_Learning": {
    "Definition": "Supervised Machine Learning is a type of machine learning where an algorithm is trained on labeled data, meaning the input data comes with corresponding output labels.",
    "Goal": "The goal is for the algorithm to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs so that it can predict the correct label for new, unseen data.",
    "Process": "This process involves feeding the algorithm with example input-output pairs during training, allowing it to learn the relationships and patterns that will help it make accurate predictions when faced with new data."
